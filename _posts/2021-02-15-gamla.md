Gamla Stan is particularly revered for the preservation of its sites and monuments, understanding that the Old Town and its cobblestone roads date back to the thirteenth century. This area and its aesthetics serve as an inspiration for the world to continue to preserve the character of the past. Meanwhile, the facet of being an easily accessible and centrally located area allows for increased foot traffic and visitors. This, among other factors, has led to a steady rise in visitation, up until 2019, holding a higher volume of visitors than the average of [all Northern European countries.](https://www.worlddata.info/europe/sweden/tourism.php)  With this rise in visitation and interest, the surrounding areas also begin to see an increase in retail as new customers flood the streets to experience history in Gamla Stan. Despite the impact of COVID-19 on tourism and revenue, they hope to regain these values as the state of the world gravitates towards normalcy. Ultimately, Gamla Stanâ€™s ability to combine history, experience, and easy-access has allowed it to continually grow and serve as a model for other placemaking communities.
