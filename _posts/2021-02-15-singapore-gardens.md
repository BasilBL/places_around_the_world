Singapore’s #1 attraction on TripAdvisor is more than just another beautiful garden. Gardens by the Bay was envisioned as part of a larger plan by the National Parks Board Singapore to transform Singapore from a Garden City to a [City in a Garden](https://www.csc.gov.sg/articles/a-city-in-a-garden). Over a decade ago, the Singaporean government sought to develop three world-class gardens on reclaimed land around the Marina Bay waterfront, which the government hoped would draw in local Singaporeans and tourists from around the world. During the [2019/20](https://www.gardensbythebay.com.sg/en/the-gardens/about-us/corporate-information.html) fiscal year, Gardens by the Bay received over 13.1 million visitors and has received over 65.6 million visitors since it broke ground in 2008.
