Having opened in 1843, Tivoli Gardens is considered the second oldest amusement park in the world, serving as an inspiration to many other parks of its kind to follow, such as [Disney World](https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/7479876/tivoli-theme-park-walt-disney-disneyland/#:~:text=THERE'S%20an%20amusement%20park%20in,after%20another%20park%20in%20Denmark). Located in the heart of Copenhagen, this antique amusement park is one of the largest attractions that the city has to offer. The gardens span all different elements of activity, including rollercoasters, gardens of flower beds, food from across the world, and venues for live music and concerts. But perhaps what is most impressive about this landmark is its public sentiment, in continuing to draw consistent numbers of visitors to the park. Unfortunately, the park has been shut down since December 9, 2020, due to [COVID-19](https://www.tivoligardens.com/en/praktisk/coronavirus#:~:text=Information%20about%20COVID%2D19&text=To%20comply%20with%20the,Tivoli%20will%20unfortunately%20be%20closed) regulations placed by the government, however, they look forward to re-opening their gates soon.

Tivoli Gardens and its cultural inclusion continues to draw in visitors, serving as a great model and inspiration for other placemaking examples of this caliber. Over the last 10 years, they have continued to draw in approximately [4 million visitors](https://www.statista.com/statistics/236199/attendance-at-the-tivoli-gardens-theme-park/#:~:text=Tivoli%20Gardens%20Denmark%20theme%20park%20attendance%202009%2D2019&text=The%20graph%20depicts%20the%20attendance,year's%20total%20of%204.85%20million) a year, demonstrating an ability to consistently interest and attract customers. Meanwhile, they have drawn more than a [300 million DKK (Danish Krone)](https://www.danskindustri.dk/di-business/arkiv/news/2019/2/denmark-is-proficient-at-making-money-from-tourists/) increase in revenue per year. The blend of cultures and appeals to different groups of ages and interests, whether it be those interested in experiencing food from around the world or a couple on a date, is what drives their success and continues to attract visitors. Tivoli Gardens provides a community in which people of all lifestyles can come together and find comfort. As the park cultivates a sense of inclusion to all visitors, there is also a subsequent benefit to the surrounding communities, as they draw business to retail operations and attribute to the atmosphere of wonder in Copenhagen. With this, Tivoli Gardens will continue to serve as a place of interest since their opening in the nineteenth century, achieved through incorporating multiple different venues, cultures, and attractions in one place, acting as an example of success for other places of its kind.
